## File Upload

This system supports minio file upload

The configuration of file upload, generally do not need to be configured once.

The file upload process is divided into two types:

1. Upload the file to the server, upload it to the minio through the server, save it, and then save it locally. This form of uploading requires twice as much traffic
2. Return a key such as a token through the server, and then the front end has the right to upload directly to minio. This form of upload only needs to consume the traffic of a single upload

We use the second form of uploading, because the front end needs to be compatible with minio upload, so not only the background, but also the front end needs to be configured for file uploading

First, we need to modify the file upload configuration in the background. The file upload configuration in the background is configured in the configuration center of `nacos`

Log in to `nacos`, enter the configuration management - configuration list, select a different namespace according to the production environment or test environment, for example, the test environment is the namespace of `public`

According to the packaged configuration, find `application-{environment}.yml` for editing

```yaml
biz:
  oss:
    # resources-url是带有bucket的
    resources-url: http://34.126.131.177:9000/mall4cloud
    type: 1
    endpoint: http://34.126.131.177:9000
    bucket: mall4cloud
    access-key-id: admin
    access-key-secret: admin123456
```

These variables are explained as follows:

- type: file upload type 1.minio
- bucket: a bucket for file upload and archive (just treat it as the largest folder)
  - For the bucket created by `minio` when the middleware is built, refer to the one-click installation of the middleware, the created bucket
- access-key-id:
  - minio can directly obtain the account password according to the command started by docker, here is `MINIO_ROOT_USER`, which is the login account
- access-key-secret:
  - minio can directly obtain the account password according to the command started by docker, here is `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, which is the login password
- endpoint: the path to upload when the file is uploaded
  - minio is the path to minio
- resources-url: resources-url is with bucket
  - minio is the path of minio + bucket

In addition to modifying the image upload configuration in the background, the front-end also needs to modify the file upload configuration.

1. `mall4cloud-admin`, `mall4cloud-platform` For these two projects, modify the `.env.{environment}` related files in the root directory, such as modifying the `.env.development` file for the development environment.

- VUE_APP_RESOURCES_URL: corresponds to the resources-url configured in the background above
- VUE_APP_RESOURCES_TYPE: corresponds to the type of the background configuration above

2. `mall4cloud-pc` This project modifies `plugins/config.js`

- resourcesUrl: corresponds to the resources-url configured in the background above
- resourcesActionType: corresponds to the type of the background configuration above

3. `mall4cloud-uniapp` This project modifies `src/utils/config.js`

- resourcesUrl: corresponds to the resources-url configured in the background above
- resourcesActionType: corresponds to the type of the background configuration above
